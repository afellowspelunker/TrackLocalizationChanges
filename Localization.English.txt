UIIntro.uitext,"<i>Buried in the depths of an isolated mountainside, the Deephall Stronghold is perpetually under siege.\n\nA highly superstitious community, the citizens of Deephall believe that it is essential to separate all that is deemed righteous from all that is deemed wicked, even their own dead.  Long ago, they began the tradition of separating bodies to segregated burial grounds after death based on the judgement of that person's virtue during life.\n\nThen the dead began to rise.  At first they came slowly, in small numbers, and only from the crypt where the evil were buried.  The city was well defended, and the local clergy held this as proof that their superstitions were well founded.  Now they come in droves, from both graveyards, and the guards have begun to lose hope.  This is what you have come to investigate.</i>"
